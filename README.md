## Location and Time

We will meet from 9-16 with breaks around 1030 and 1430.

All meetings will be held in the B and D Houses of the Biology Building located on Sölvegatan 35.

We suggest entering the building from the main entrance on the south side of the building (facing the new LTH tram stop).

Once inside, you are on the ‘second floor’ (floor 2), turn left to access the B and D houses. https://maps.app.goo.gl/GDTBdNb1kQpW2FDo8

* B327 Syndpunkten - Conference room on the third floor of House B
* D227 Retina - Second floor of House D
* D107 Etiketten - First floor of House D

For lunch, there is a canteen in the Ecology House that will be open. There are also multiple lunchrooms we will have access to with microwaves.


## Format & Evaluation

We think that coding is best learned by doing!
Therefore there will be very few formal ‘lecturers’ in this course.
Instead, we will have guided exercises and tutorials ending in a mini-project for you to complete to apply what you learned.
Attendance in mandatory each day to receive credits (3 hp). Evaluation is pass/fail based on participation and completion of the exercises.
